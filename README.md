The idea was to develop a 4x4 game board with 16 slots.
Each slot containing cards faced-down.
The player is to flip two cards each time, trying to find equals. If the two cards are equal, the player receives one point, and the cards are removed from the game board. Otherwise, the player loses one point and the cards are turned face-down again. This continues until all pairs have been found.
